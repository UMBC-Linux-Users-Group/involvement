\section*{Who We Are}

We are students who use or want to use Linux. We meet weekly to chat and help
each other solve problems, and organize other events to promote free and open
source software.

% May want to re-order these, though ``What is linux'' is probably a good thing to open
% with.
\section*{What Is Linux}

Linux is an operating system similar to OS X or Windows, except that it is free
and open source, built by volunteers over the years since 1991.


\section*{What We Do}

% This section might benefit from being expanded on after the bullets, but probably
% bullets first.

\begin{itemize} \large
    % Line spacing probably needs adjustment.
    % Describe other things as well
\item Help beginning users get installed and set up on Linux.
\item Advice and support for beginning users.
\item Tutorials for developer tools
\item Promote Linux and Free, Open-Source Software
\end{itemize}

\section*{Why Linux?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linux is free.

  Both the operating system and most of the software we use on it are developed by
  volunteers and have their source code posted online. Each linux distribution has
  thousands of useful programs available in online repositories ready to be downloaded and
  installed for free.

\item Linux is customizable.

  Different groups which distribute Linux package it with different software to suit
  different needs. Linux users can choose what software to install to customize their
  distribution to their liking. Available customization includes everything from graphical
  elements like what windows look like to core system configurationg like which background
  processes are started at boot, and when they are started.

\item Linux runs everywhere.

  Because it is free, and highly customizable, Linux is popular for a huge variety of use
  cases. Web servers, mobile divices, and integrated systems all frequently run
  Linux. Learning to use it (even if you don't end up keeping it as your desktop operating
  system, which we hope you do) is a very useful job skill for any programmer.
