\section*{About Us}

We are students who use or want to use Linux. We meet weekly to chat and help
each other solve problems, and organize other events to promote free and open
source software.

What is Linux? Linux is an operating system similar to OS X or Windows, except
that it is free and open source, built by volunteers over the years since 1991.

We also help beginners through the process of installing and learning Linux,
provide tutorials, and act as the go-to resource for Linux questions and
answers.

\section*{Why Linux?}

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent
\textbf{Linux is free} --- Linux is entirely free to use, and most of the pieces
of Linux carry permissive licenses, which allow everyone to see the code for and
offer contributions

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent
\textbf{Linux is customizable} --- Users can choose what software to install on
their computer, and customize look and feel, as well as fundamental behavior, to
any degree they like.

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent
\textbf{Linux runs everywhere} --- Nearly every part of the world which uses
computers also uses Linux in some way. Web servers, mobile devices, and
integrated systems (like your car) all run Linux.
