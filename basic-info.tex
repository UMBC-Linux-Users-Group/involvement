\section*{Who We Are}

We are students who use or want to use Linux. We meet weekly to chat and help
each other solve problems, and organize other events to promote free and open
source software.

% May want to re-order these, though ``What is linux'' is probably a good thing to open
% with.
\section*{What Is Linux}

Linux is an operating system similar to OS X or Windows, except that it is free
and open source, built by volunteers over the years since 1991.


\section*{What We Do}

% This section might benefit from being expanded on after the bullets, but probably
% bullets first.

\begin{itemize} \large
    % Line spacing probably needs adjustment.
    % Describe other things as well
\item Help beginning users get installed and set up on Linux.
\item Advice and support for beginning users.
\item Tutorials for developer tools
\end{itemize}

% Some of the stuff here can probably be used in the other sections, but we want to keep
% it fairly terse. Try not to get too deep on the FOSS philosophy; I'd probably avoid
% mentioning it at all outside of saying that this stuff is free.
