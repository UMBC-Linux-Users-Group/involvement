    Linux Users Group
    \vspace{0.5em}
\end{center}

We are students who use or want to use Linux, the free and open source computer
operating system. Our members range in skill-level from deeply knowledgeable
gurus to the totally uninitiated, and we welcome everyone, whether or not you
have already stepped into the world of free and open source software (\foss).

Some of our members meet each week to chat, have lunch, and enjoy each others'
company while discussing Linux, and the ecosystem of software surrounding it.
While we are there, we often help each other troubleshoot problems, seek out
software to use, and help new users learn about and to install Linux on their
laptops.
